# 👋 Hi, I’m Samyakt

i am 24 years old and I am freelance web developer. I started to learn code in end of 2020. I started with C/C++ and built small projects like snake & chess game. 
Then I learned front-end, back-end as node.js and mongoDB as data base and I got into full-stack freelancer in mid of 2021. 

The Tech-companies like linux, aws, google changing there codebase from C/C++ to Rust, I wanted to know why Rust, then I gotta know Rust as awesome features like 
owership borrowing model, no memory leak, no garbage collection, fast, secure and much more... 

Then I learned Rust and build photorealistic 3D renderer from scratch!
With the help of [Ray Tracer Challenge book](https://github.com/codingxjourney/ray-tracer-challenge) and this is my old github.
now I wanted to work on web3 🔥
